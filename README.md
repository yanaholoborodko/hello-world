# hello-world

Hey everyone:)

I am a beginning front-end programmer:)
I study Computer Science in Poland. My hobbies besides programming are photography,
reading books on psychology and self-development, running, yoga, learning languages 
(currently Polish & Spanish) and travelling:)

My dream is to become professional in the chosen field and travel the world!
